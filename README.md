# Why?
An `AnimatedSprite` is an amazing tool for easy spritesheet animation, and `SpriteFrames` are a great data container. Especially when paired with plugins such as [Godot Aseprite Wizard](https://github.com/viniciusgerevini/godot-aseprite-wizard).

However, the `AnimationPlayer` node is much better when it cames to syncing various gameplay elements such as particles, sound effects and colliders to animations. Animating a spritesheet with an AnimationPlayer is a pain because you would need to manually set every keyframe, making sure you're playing it at the correct FPS.

So, `AnimationPlayer SpriteFrames Helper` is here to automate the boring for you.

# How To
* Follow the [ Godot plugin installation guide]( https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/plugins/editor/installing_plugins.html).
* Enable the plugin in the Project Settings:

A new view will now appear in your Inspector dock when you select any `AnimationPlayer`:

You can select which `AnimationPlayer` animation you want to edit:

What `AnimatedSprite` should be targeted in the animation:

What `SpriteFrames` animation to use:

And finally, you can select to `Fill` and `Set Length`:
- `Fill` will fill up the animation for the selected keyframe until the end of the animation
- `Set Length` will set the lenght of the animation to be as long as is required to play the full `SpriteFrame` animation once

Pressing the **`Insert`** button will inject tracks for `frames`, `animation` and `frame` properties into the selected animation, starting from the current playback position. You can adjust this in the animation dock.
